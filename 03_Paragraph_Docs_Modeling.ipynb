       " 'first half of this century, the book is particularly revealing in that  it also exposes many of the strategies that are to be employed.  Wells\\' introduction to the book is titled, \"The Dream Book of  Dr. Philip Raven.\" In a familiar ploy of the science fiction of the  time, the book is introduced as the factual work of a Dr. Raven, a  deceased friend of Wells, and a member of the Geneva     13     Secretariat coyly described as having \"unusual opportunities for  forming judgments upon the trend of things.\" Wells maintained',\n",
       " 'that Raven wrote the book using the curious technique of  transcribing during his waking hours a book of future history  that he read during his nightly dreams. This is the fictional  vehicle by which Wells sounds the clarion call for the New World  Order.   The dream book purports to be a work of history, written  from the perspective of a citizen of a future Utopian world-state.  Wells terms the book \"a Short History of the World for about the  next century and a half and an \"Outline of the Future.\"',\n",
       " 'He commences his reverse history with a reiteration of actual  events up to his own time, describing how the evolution of  communications and transportation has brought the human race  into closer contact than ever before — global village stuff —  although he comments that \"Distribution, paper supply, and  news services had fallen into the hands of powerful groups able  and willing to crush out any... inimical schools of public  suggestion. They set about stereotyping the public mind.\"  Not surprisingly Wells places the City of London — the',\n",
       " 'international center of banking culture — and its financial credit  as responsible for knitting together world economic life over the  previous hundred years. With these innovations in commun-  ications and finance, but also with the frustrations and wars  inherent (so he says) in the existence of independent national  states and sovereignties, came about the gradual dawning of the  idea of the World- State.   Wells muses, \"By this time (1919) there was indeed quite a  considerable number of intelligent people in the world who had',\n",
       " 'realized the accumulating necessity of a world government, and  a still larger multitude... who had apprehended it instinctively  and sentimentally, but there was no one yet who had the  intellectual vigor to attack in earnest the problem of substituting  a world system for the existing governments.\" He also describes  a one-world government as \"manifestly the only possible  solution of the human problem.\"   Like many another wealthy individual advocating a one-world  state for the \"common good,\" Wells did not believe that',\n",
       " 'commoners were capable of running that world-state. He  described democracies as exercising \"a political fiction of a very  extraordinary kind: that every subject... was equally capable of  making whatever collective decisions had to be made.\" And so  this New World Order would be run by the few, by those upper-     14     crust and white racialist Englishmen and their anglophilic  American associates, the men that Wells saw as being capable of  doing so.   Referring in the book to the Versailles Peace Conference that',\n",

But it is doubtful if at any time he  realized that a world pax means a world control of all the vital  common interests of mankind.\"   Within a litany of bright ideas leading up to the acceptance of  the one-world-state, Wells notes Wilson\\'s abortive League of  Nations, precursor to the U.N., but mourns its failures and  regrets that the League, where \"The World-State had appeared',\n",
       " 'dimly and evasively, as an aspiration, as a remote possibility...  had no executive powers, no certain revenues, no army, no  police, and practically no authority to do anything at all.\" Wells  warns the builders of the world- state not to make that mistake  again. They would not.   Wells even indicates the presence of conspiratorial factions  involved in the creation of the unified world order during the  twentieth century, the sort of men that he cozied up to in real  life in London\\'s exclusive clubs. Wells says that, \"strange',\n",
       " 'Mystery Men were dimly visible through a fog of baffling evasions  and mis-statements, manipulating prices and exchanges.  Prominent among these Mystery Men was a certain Mr. Montagu  Norman, Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1935.\"  Not surprisingly, this is the same Montagu Norman who was a  rabid pre-war partisan of Hitler, and who participated with  Hjalmar Schacht, with American intelligence, with Wall Street,  and with the Rothschild/Warburg/Schiff banks in the creation of  Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. \"Another big obscure financial',\n",
       " 'force in the war and post-war periods,\" Wells goes on, \"was the  complex of great private banking ganglia, of which Morgan and  Co., with its associated firms, was the most central and most  typical.\"   Wells marks the transition from the date of his actual writing  of his book, the early 1930s, to his elitist, technocratic vision of  the future with a section about the coming war — World War II,  that is — and what he sees as its terrible aftermath, titled, \"The  Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration.\"',\n",
       " 'H.G. Wells was not the only person during the post- World War  I period to see that another devastating world war was nearly  inevitable. Wells has World War II beginning in 1940 in Poland,     15     over an imagined slight taken by a Nazi over the actions of a Pole  of Jewish origin. He characterizes World War II as it was, as an  orgy of world violence, and has the fighting end in 1949 — staying  remarkably close to the actual dates of the conflict — only to be  followed by another scourge, that of rampant disease, \"The Raid',\n",
       " 'of the Germs.\"   Given the present-day climate of AIDS, Ebola, Mad Cow  disease, and other resistant viral strains — and the persistent  rumors of the military engineering of those same  diseases — perhaps Wells\\' dating in this particular should have  been moved forward a few years.   In Wells\\' scenario, years of terrible war and disease result in  the near-total disintegration of society. Wells places the final  break-up of the nation-states and \"America in Liquidation\" at  1966, when \"the great patchwork of empires and nationalist',\n",
       " 'states, set up during the Age of European Predominance, lost its  defining lines, lost its contrasted cultures and its elaborated  traditions, and ceased to divide the allegiance and devotion of  men of goodwill.\"   Wells was no prophet as regards his timeline, only a science  fiction writer privy to the plans of men with an interest in  promoting the coming of the dictatorial world-state. His crystal  ball is somewhat cloudy on certain details. Obviously his  prediction of the destruction of civilization did not come to pass',\n",

Another mainstay in the arsenal of elitist mind control  research was the work of Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, who studied  physiology at Leipzig in 1884, five years after Wundt had a  laboratory there, and first worked at the St. Petersburg Military  Medical Academy in Russia. In 1906 Pavlov cut holes in dogs'  cheeks and inserted tubes to measure salivation. A bell was rung  just before food was given to the dogs, and after a period of time\",\n",

Watson,  the founder of what is known as the behaviorist school of  psychology — but is really only research following in the dark  shadow of Wundt — believed that complex forms of behavior could  be programmed into humans. He conducted one experiment in  which a young boy, \"Little Albert,\" was given a white rat to play  with.

The boy was understandably terrified by such lunatic  behavior, and eventually reacted with terror every time the rat  was given to him, and finally, whenever any small furry animal  was around him.   Dr. Watson himself drooled over the possibilities of this kind  of mechanical conditioning of human beings: \"Give me the baby,  and I\\'ll make it climb and use its hands in constructing  buildings of stone or wood...

Hall  was the mentor of one of the most influential names in American  education of this century: John Dewey.   Dewey studied under Hall at Johns Hopkins, moving on to',\n",

Another  major influence upon Dewey was the Hegelian philosopher  George Sylvester Morris, who had received his doctorate from  the University of Berlin. According to Dewey, echoing the  sentiments of his Prussian mentors,   \"There is no god, and there is no soul. There are no needs  for the props of traditional religion.   \"With dogma and creed excluded, then immutable truth is  also dead and buried.   \"There is no room for fixed, natural law or permanent moral',\n",
       " 'absolutes.\" [4]   Dewey published the first American textbook on Hegelian  philosophy as applied to the Wundtian psychological innovations  in his book Psychology. In 1895 he joined the faculty at the  Rockefeller-funded University of Chicago, heading the  philosophy, psychology, and teaching departments, and  establishing an education laboratory called the Dewey School,  later known as the Laboratory School of the University of  Chicago.   Dewey followed the Wundtian example in his insistence that',\n",
       " 'education was not the teaching of mental skills such as reading  and writing, but in the channeling of raw experiences to the  evolving mind of the child; a sort of psychic Skinner\\'s box  version of education. The traditional role of the teacher as  educator was replaced by the teacher as shrink, socializer,     37     eugenicist and herald of the coming world superstate.  Dewey believed that the purpose of public schools was to  \"take an active part in determining the social order of the  future... according as the teachers align themselves with the',\n",
       " 'newer forces making for social control of economic forces.\" [5]  Dewey also remarked that \"The school is primarily a social  institution. Education being a social process, the school is  simply that form of community life in which all those agencies  are concentrated that will be most effective in bringing the child  to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his  own powers for social ends. Education, therefore, is a process  of living and not a preparation for future living.\" [6]',\n",
       " \"For Dewey, the issue was always how the child related to the  State, rather than how the State related to the child.  Another student of Wundt, who was to prove to be perhaps  the most successful popularizer of the new psychology that  abolished the psyche, was James McKeen Cattell. Cattell was  Wundt's assistant in Leipzig in the years 1883-86, receiving his  Ph.D. from the grand old man in 1886. Lecturing in Cambridge  in 1887, Cattell met and was converted to Social Darwinism by  Darwin's cousin, the English psychologist Francis Galton, the\",\n",

In 1887 Cattell established at the University of Pennsylvania a  psychological laboratory of the Wundtian mold, then moved on in  1891 to head the new psychology department at Columbia  University. Cattell was tremendously influential in disseminating  the new overtly materialistic psychology, and did so by  establishing a host of magazines, including The Psychological  Review, Science, Scientific Monthly, and School and Society.',\n",
       " 'He also published reference works including American Men of  Science, Leaders in Education, and The Directory of American  Scholars, an effective strategy for screwing Wundtian- school  psychologists into the mainstream of American thought.  Another of Cattell\\'s questionable feats was the abolition of the  use of phonics methods for teaching reading. Cattell popularized  the \"Look-Say\" method of teaching reading, a technique that  according to some sources had been invented by Thomas  Hopkins Gallaudet for teaching the deaf. Although Gallaudet was',\n",
       " 'not a member of Skull and Bones, two of his sons attended Yale  and were initiated into the secret society.   Following upon the insight of Gallaudet in teaching the deaf,  Cattell came to the conclusion that the direct memorization of     38     words would increase literacy if applied to normal students.  Experience in subsequent years has not proven this to be the  case, obviously, and one byproduct of Cattell\\'s advocacy of the  \"Look-Say\" theory is that as we approach the 21st century  millions of American adults cannot read or write at all.',\n",
       " 'The whole story about Gallaudet may in fact be a sanitization  of what actually happened. Educator John Taylor Gatto  attributes the \"Look-Say\" method to the Prussian system of  schooling, where this system of not-teaching-reading was used  essentially to disadvantage all but the privileged class. Gatto  says, \"So they figured out that by replacing the alphabet system  of teaching reading we teach sounds. (The Prussian System was  a whole sentence system, rather than a whole word system. You  memorize whole sentences.) If they could get the kids and keep',\n",
       " 'them from reading well for the first six and seven years, then it  didn\\'t matter after that. They had broken the link between  printed information.\" [7]   Possibly the most effective Trojan horse for injecting the  Wundtian theory of man-as-machine into the American  educational establishment was an individual, James Earl Russell,  who studied under and received his doctorate from Wundt in  1894. Russell became dean of the New York College for the  Training of Teachers, which he would run for thirty years while',\n",

Another luminary in the shrink-wrapping of American  education was Edward Lee Thorndike, who studied with  Wundtians Armstrong and Judd at Wesleyan University, graduat-  ing in 1895. Thorndike moved on to Columbia University,  where he specialized in studying animals in \"puzzle box\" mazes,  finally finding his niche at Teachers College under Russell.',\n",

In this definition the term stimulus is used  widely for any event which influences a person, — for a word  spoken to him, a look, a sentence which he reads, the air he  breathes, etc. etc. The term response is used for any reaction  made by him, — anew thought, a feeling of interest, a bodily act,  any mental or bodily condition resulting from the stimulus. The',\n",
       " 'aim of the teacher is to produce desirable and prevent  undesirable changes in human beings by producing and  preventing certain responses. The means at the disposal of the     39     teacher are the stimuli which can be brought to bear upon the  pupil, — the teacher\\'s words, gestures, and appearance, the  condition and appliances of the school room, the books to be  used, and objects to be seen, and so on through a long list of the  things and events which the teacher can control.\" [8]  Thorndike further stated,',\n",
       " '\"Studies of the capacities and interests of young children  indicate the advisability of placing little emphasis before the age  of six upon either the acquisition of those intellectual resources  known as the formal tools — reading, spelling, arithmetic,  writing, etc. — or upon abstract intellectual analysis...  \"Despite rapid progress in the right direction the program of  the average elementary school is too narrow and academic in  character. Traditionally the elementary school has been  primarily devoted to teaching the fundamental subjects, the',\n",
       " \"three R's, and closely related disciplines... Artificial exercises,  like drills on phonetics, multiplication tables, and formal writing  movements, are used to a wasteful degree. Subjects such as  arithmetic, language, and history include content that is  intrinsically of little value. Nearly every subject is enlarged  unwisely to satisfy the academic ideal of thoroughness. That the  typical school overemphasizes instruction in these formal,  academic skills as a means of fostering intellectual resources... is\",\n",
       " 'a justifiable criticism... Elimination of unessentials by scientific  study, then, is one step in improving the curriculum.\" [9]  The emphasis by Thorndike and his fellows on the  \"socialization\" of the student — in fact the subjugation of the  student to the social order — as opposed to the teaching of  specific skills, is another factor that has led to a general  breakdown of literacy in the United States, while at the same  time providing no noticeable increase in the ability to  socialize — in fact, obviously the contrary.',\n",
       " 'Thorndike believed that, \"Education is interested primarily  in the general interrelation of man and his environment, in all  the changes which make possible a better adjustment of human  nature to its surroundings.\"   This is another important aspect of Thorndike\\'s and all of the  other latter-day Wundtians\\' philosophies.

       " 'Lieutenant Commander Thomas Narut, a U.S. Navy  psychologist stationed at the U.S. Regional Medical Center in  Naples, Italy, in 1979 admitted to Navy programs to create mind  controlled assassins. Narut made this apparent gaffe at the  NATO conference for psychologists on \"Dimensions of Stress  and Anxiety\" in Oslo, Norway.   The topic Narut spoke on at the conference was \"The Use of  a Symbolic Model and Verbal Intervention in Inducing and  Reducing Stress,\" but his spiel was mostly about the benefits of',\n",
       " 'doing research for the Navy. One thing he mentioned was that  there was no shortage of enlisted men who could be studied,     118     with psych profiles and background available on all subjects.  Afterwards, in a small group that included Peter Watson of  the London Sunday Times, Narut was more candid about what  the Navy was up to. He talked about his work with \"combat  readiness units,\" whose participants included commandos and  undercover operatives at U.S. embassies worldwide, including  \"hit men and assassins.\" According to Narut, these men were',\n",
       " 'desensitized by being strapped into a chair with their heads  immobilized and eyelids clamped open, while they were forced  to view violent true life splatter flicks, until finally the men were  totally callous toward scenes of horrible carnage. Among the  films shown were a brutal African circumcision, and a man  having his fingers sawed off in a sawmill. Another technique of  desensitization that was employed was propaganda aimed to  make the customs and culture of another country appear as evil',\n",
       " 'and less than human. Narut stated that successful programming  of assassins took only a few weeks.   Candidates for assassination training were taken from  submarine crews and paratroops, but included convicted  murderers from military prisons. Another source of mind  control fodder for the assassination programs was soldiers who  had been awarded for bravery. Narut said that the men selected  were programmed at the Navy neuropsychiatric lab in San Diego,  California, and also at the Naples, Italy medical installation.',\n",
       " 'Although Narut admitted that he did not have a high enough  clearance to know where all of the programmed assassins were  sent, he did know that some had been stationed in the Naples  embassy — this would have provided for easy deployment  throughout Europe.

Although admitting that Narut was on Naval staff in Naples, they',\n",

A short time later Narut  gave a press conference in which he stated that the information  he had offered had only been theoretical — these were the kind of  programs that the Navy might do in the future. Soon after, the  U.S. Naval headquarters in London reported that Narut\\'s rash  statements had been made due to his \"personal problems.\"  This was almost certainly not true. Dr. Irwin Sarason, one of the',\n",

In this way, one could develop a system that would  seriously impair the brain performance of very large populations  in selected regions over an extended period.\\' No matter how  deeply disturbing the thought of using the environment to  manipulate behavior for national advantages to some, the  technology permitting such use will very probably develop  within the next few decades.\" [1]   Early electromagnetic weapons experiments were conducted   by the Japanese during World War EL Information on these',\n",
       " '\"death rays\" was revealed when Japanese scientists were   interrogated. According to reports of the scientists the death ray   was never used on humans, but was tested on animals. [2]   In 1960 there were rumors of a fantastic new Soviet super   weapon employing Nikola Tesla electromagnetic technology.   With subsequent revelations about Soviet research in these   areas, it seems that these rumors were true. [3]   During the 1960s high levels of electromagnetic radiation   were detected at the American embassy in Moscow. It was de-',\n",

One guess  was that a microwave beam was used to activate electronic  equipment hidden within the building; another guess was more  macabre: that the beam was being used to disrupt the nervous  systems of American workers in the embassy. Giving weight to  the latter supposition, many of the employees of the embassy  became ill. Ambassador Walter Stoessel suffered a rare blood',\n",
       " 'disease likened to leukemia, and experienced headaches and  bleeding from the eyes. At least two other employees  contracted cancer. According to researcher Alex Constantine,  rather than informing embassy personnel of what was going on,  the CIA chose to study the effects of the irradiation.  Dr. Milton Zaret, called in to investigate what was termed  \"the Moscow Signal,\" reported that the CIA wondered \"whether  I thought the electromagnetic radiation beamed at the brain  from a distance could affect the way a person might act,\" and,',\n",
       " '\"could microwaves be used to facilitate brainwashing or to break  down prisoners under investigation.\" Zaret\\'s conclusion about  the Moscow Signal was that, \"Whatever other reasons the  Russians may have had, they believed the beam would modify the  behavior of personnel.\" [4]   Author Len Bracken, who was present in Moscow at the time,  has stated to the author in correspondence that the microwave  radiation was beamed from a shack on a building across from the  embassy. In 1977 the microwave shack caught fire and burned.',\n",
       " 'Bracken says, \"It was a Friday night and the Marine House Bar  was playing \\'Burn, Baby, Burn\\' [i.e. \"Disco Inferno\"].\" Bracken  also relates that \"in \\'79 a strange box was installed in the wall in  my room [in Moscow], supposedly relating to the heating  system.\" [5]   Irradiation of the American embassy reportedly prompted a  response from the Americans: the Defense Advanced Research  Projects Agency\\'s Project PANDORA, conducted at the Walter  Reed Army Institute of Research from 1965 to 1970. One',\n",
       " 'aspect of the project involved bombarding chimpanzees with  microwave radiation. Referencing a reported statement by the  head of the project, \"the potential for exerting a degree of  control on human behavior by low level microwave radiation  seems to exist and he urged that the effects of microwaves be  studied for possible weapons applications.\"   Within three years, Dr. Gordon J.F. McDonald, a scientific  advisor to the president at the time, indicated that  \"Perturbation of the environment can produce changes in',\n",
       " '202     behavioral patterns.\" The perturbation that McDonald was  alluding to was EM waves, and the changes in behavior were  altered brain wave patterns. [6]   In 1965 the McFarlane Corporation in America came up with  the Buck Rogers-sounding \"modulated electron gun X-ray  nuclear booster,\" a breakthrough in the \"death ray\" technology.  Reports indicate that the device could also be used in  communications, telemetry, and remote controlled guidance  systems. McFarlane later claimed that the system was stolen',\n",

[7]  In 1972 the army admitted extensive research into the  effects of irradiation on life forms, and the technology of electro-  magnetic weaponry. One of the byproducts of this research led  to the invention of a powerful \"electronic flame thrower.\" This  may have been the weapon described in a study of the U.S. Army',\n",

Byrd wrote that, \"At a certain  frequency and power intensity, they could make the animal',\n",

Beck, \"Anecdotal  data amassed suggesting that a pocket-sized transmitter at  power levels of under 100 milliwatts could drastically alter the  moods of unsuspecting persons, and that vast geographical areas  could be surreptitiously mood manipulated by invisible and  remote transmissions of EM [electromagnetic] energy.\" [11]  In the late 1970s Russian negotiators at the Strategic Arms  Limitation talks (SALT II), proposed banning \"a new generation',\n",
       " 'of weapons of mass destruction\" employing electromagnetic  pulses. It has been suggested that the Russians, in proposing  the ban, were attempting to feel out the Americans as to the  current state of their electromagnetic weapons research. The  Americans did not seem to have a clue as to what the Russians  were talking about, and the proposal was tabled.  In fact, some Americans knew exactly what the Russians were  talking about, although the Reds had a significant head start on  several fronts. In 1959 Russian scientists Gaponov, Schneider,',\n",

By the 1980s, it was reported,     204     Russian gyrotron weapons had been reduced in size so that they  would fit into a regular military truck, and had the capability of  wiping out large military implacements or, at lower frequencies,  irradiating whole towns.

A rapidly scanning RFR system could  provide an effective stun or kill capability over a large area.\" [13]  In 1984 the program researching the creation of pulsed  microwaves was stepped up at Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratories.

According to an FCC report, \"microwaves were the  likely cause of several sudden illnesses among faculty  researchers at Oregon State University.\" Numerous residents  also complained of headaches, insomnia, fatigue, skin redness,  and hearing clicks and buzzes in the head.   A study conducted by the Pacific Northwest Center for Non-  Ionizing Radiation attributed the radiation instead to the Soviets,  stating that it was \"psychoactive\" and \"very strongly suggesting',\n",
       " 'of achieving the objective of brain control.\" [15]  In September 1985, members of the Greenham Commons  Women\\'s Peace Camp in Great Britain, a global militarization  protest camp located outside the U.S. Air Force Base at  Greenham Commons, began experiencing a wide range of  unpleasant physical symptoms including headache, depression,  disorientation, memory loss, vertigo, and changes in their  menstrual cycles.

I do not maintain that reports such as  these are absolute proof of government electromagnetic testing  on citizenry, but well-reasoned accounts such as the following  must be taken into consideration:   \"The large black top of the Federal Building in San Francisco  looks like a giant air-conditioning vent, 50 feet tall, comprising  the entire top of the building. It is actually a radar, microwave,',\n",

It is on the low rise of this  hill where San Francisco's 'Skid Row' district, the 'Tenderloin,'  uneasily rests. And so the Federal Building can be seen from  virtually any place in the Tenderloin.

Since I have had the fortune to live for three years in this ring of  hell, the Tenderloin, I have noticed something very odd. At  least 15 times I have noticed in the morning or early evening a  pronounced buzzing or humming. Very low and hard to hear.

And I  felt that my thoughts were disrupted. The buzzing seemed to  make thoughts fall apart just before forming, like sand on a  vibrating metal plate, and I felt vaguely angry. On the third or  fourth occurrence of this, I noticed that in the wake of the  buzzing sound, an unusual number of fights could be heard  breaking out all around me.

The GWEN towers are  almost 300 feet tall, and a 330-foot web of copper wiring  extends out from them, broadcasting bursts of very low  frequency (VLF) messages at 20 minute intervals or, from',\n",
       " 'another source, hour intervals. These towers are spaced 200  miles apart from each other and describe a straight line across  America. At this time there are 54 operational towers, although  at least 29 more are scheduled to be constructed.  It is claimed that GWEN is part of the COG (Continuity of  Government) program of the Federal Emergency Management  Agency, designed to keep government functional in the case of  disaster, including nuclear war. Some sources disagree that this  is the purpose of the project, citing the statement of Colonel',\n",
       " 'Paul Hanson, GWEN Program Director for the Air Force. Hanson  has said, \"The towers will not help wage a nuclear war because  they would be destroyed in any protracted confrontation.\"  Others note that since the GWEN hardware is transistor based,  they are particularly vulnerable to the electromagnetic pulses of  nuclear explosions. The location of the GWEN towers is also a  matter of public record, meaning that they could easily be  targeted in case of war or even terrorist threat. [6]  Robert O. Becker, M.D., in Crosscurrents: The Perils of',\n",
       " 'Electropollution, says of GWEN: \"GWEN is a superb system, in  combination with cyclotron resonance, for producing behavioral  alterations in the civilian population. The average strength of  the steady geomagnetic field varies from place to place across  the United States. Therefore, if one wished to resonate a  specific ion in living things in a specific locality, one would  require a specific frequency for that location. The spacing of  GWEN transmitters 200 miles apart across the United States',\n",
       " '215     would allow such specific frequencies to be \\'tailored\\' to the  geomagnetic-field strength in each GWEN area.\"  A similar system is SECOM II, composed of five broadcasting  towers in Idaho, New Mexico, Missouri, South Carolina, and  Maryland. These towers were ostensibly constructed as  communication links between a central monitoring station and  vehicles carrying nuclear weapons and nuclear materials.  SECOM II broadcasts in the 3-12 Mhz range, which,  coincidentally or not, precisely blankets the resonant frequency',\n",
       " 'of the human organism. [7]   Another group of towers is mentioned in an anonymous paper  titled \"Mind Control Operations/Aquarius Group Activities,\" that  states, \"With a general ignorance through arrogance of most  public population in the U.S. the erection of large cellular towers  being carried out under HIGH TONE and ZENO are largely going  completely unnoticed. These projects are being carried out in  private business capacities and therefore in Deep Black  Operations cover. However, public populations would be wise to',\n",
       " 'educate themselves in the construction of these seemingly  innocent towers in large population areas. The cellular 800  MHZ waves are a constant wave. Due to the great proliferation of  towers in key population areas, they will have a devastating  effect.\"   An oft-heard allegation is that the CIA has developed a mind  control technology they refer to as RHIC-EDOM. The acronym  stands for \"Radio Hypnotic Intracerebra Control — Electronic  Dissolution of Memory,\" and refers to the ability to induce a',\n",
       " 'hypnotic state from a remote location, impart hypnotic  commands, and erase the memory of the programming and the  period of time that it took place in. This technology allegedly  includes electromagnetic broadcasting as well as intramuscular  implants. The erasure of memory is reportedly accomplished by  the electromagnetic stimulation of the chemical acetylcholine in  the brain.   The first mention of RHIC-EDOM was in the 1969 book Were  We Controlled? by the pseudonymous Lincoln Lawrence.  Lawrence describes RHIC-EDOM in this manner:',\n",
       " '\"It is the ultra-sophisticated application of post-hypnotic  suggestion triggered at will by radio transmission. It is a  recurring hypnotic state, reinduced automatically at intervals by  the same radio control. An individual is brought under hypnosis.  This can be done either with his knowledge — or without it by use  of narco-hypnosis, which can be brought into play under many  guises. He is then programmed to perform certain actions and     216     maintain certain attitudes upon radio signal.\"',\n",
       " \"Lawrence claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald had been  manipulated through RHIC-EDOM, but not by the Russians or  the CIA or its brethren. According to Lawrence, Oswald's  controllers had been a worldwide cabal of commodities  merchants who, through the assassination of the president,  wanted to drive stock down and make a fortune. The idea is not  entirely implausible.   The only other mention of RHIC-EDOM claiming insider  knowledge of the technology is an article by James L. Moore, in  a 1975 issue of Modern People magazine. In that article, Moore\",\n",
       " 'claimed that he possessed a 350-page manual originating from  CIA sources on RHIC-EDOM. The manual had supposedly been  prepared by the CIA shortly after the murder of John F.  Kennedy.   Verifying RHIC-EDOM are the researches of the late L.L.  Vasiliev, professor of physiology at the University of Leningrad,  who described one experiment in remote hypnosis using  undefined techniques of radio control:   \"As a control of the subject\\'s condition, when she was outside  the laboratory in another set of experiments, a radio set was',\n",
       " \"used. The results obtained indicate that the method of using  radio signals substantially enhances the experimental  possibilities. I.F. Tomaschevsky [a Russian physiologist] carried  out the first experiments with this subject at a distance of one  or two rooms, and under conditions that the participant would  not know or suspect that she would be experimented with. In  other cases, the sender was not in the same house, and someone  else observed the subject's behavior. Subsequent experiments at\",\n",
       " 'considerable distances were successful. One such experiment  was carried out in the park at a distance. Mental suggestions to  go to sleep were complied with within a minute.\" [8]  Interesting in the context of RHIC-EDOM technology is a  statement made almost ten years after the publication of Were  We Controlled? Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, the MKULTRA heavyweight,  during questioning by Senator Richard Schweicker in 1977  Senate hearings on CIA drug testing responded as follows:   SCHWEIKER: Some of the projects under MKULTRA involved',\n",
       " 'hypnosis, is that correct?  GOTTLIEB: Yes.   SCHWEICKER: Did any of these projects involve something  called radio hypnotic intracerebral control, which is a  combination, as I understand it, in layman\\'s terms, of radio     217     transmissions and hypnosis.  GOTTLIEB: My answer is \"No.\"  SCHWEICKER: None whatsoever?   GOTTLIEB: Well, I am trying to be responsive to the terms  you used. As I remember it, there was a current interest,  running interest, all the time in what effects people\\'s standing',\n",
       " 'in the field of radio energy have, and it could easily have been  that somewhere in many projects, someone was trying to see if  you could hypnotize someone easier if he was standing in a radio  beam. That would seem like a reasonable piece of research to  do. [9]   Another statement was made by J.F. Schapitz who, working  with the Department of Defense in 1974, filed the following  research proposal:   \"In this investigation it will be shown that the spoken word  of the hypnotist may be conveyed by modulated electro-magnetic',\n",
       " 'energy directly into the subconscious parts of the human  brain — i.e., without employing any technical devices for receiving  or transcoding the messages and without the person exposed to  such influence having a chance to control the information input  consciously.\"   Schapitz proposed an experiment wherein a subject would be  subconsciously told to leave the laboratory, the command  triggered by a word or action from the researcher. As in the  tricks played by stage hypnotists, Schapitz was certain that the',\n",
       " 'subject would rationalize the otherwise irrational desire to leave  the lab. Records of Schapitz\\' research, beyond the initial  proposal, have never been declassified. [10]   In a way, proof of the existence of RHIC-EDOM does not  much matter. It is not vitally important if Lincoln Lawrence or  James L. Moore were speaking from personal knowledge, or  simply speculation that they wanted to render more believable.  \"RHIC-EDOM\" is in essence just a name that describes a  technology close to or identical to others that have been',\n",
       " 'demonstrated to exist. [11]   A specific Russian mind control technology was outed by the  American Defense News in 1993, termed \"acoustic psycho-  correction.\" According to the magazine, \"The Russian capability,  demonstrated in a series of laboratory experiments dating back  to the mid-1970s, could be used to suppress riots, control  dissidents, demoralize or disable opposing forces and enhance  the performance of friendly special operations teams, sources  say.     218     \"Pioneered by the government-funded Department of Psycho-',\n",

According to Tactical Technology magazine,  \"While visiting Russia in November 1991, Morris and other  members of a team sent to investigate Russian technologies for  commercial development were invited to a demonstration of a  mind control technology. A volunteer from the U.S. team sat  down in front of a computer screen as innocuous words flashed  across the screen. The volunteer was only required to tell  which words he liked and which words he disliked. At the end',\n",
       " 'of the demonstration the Russian staff started revealing the  sensitive, innermost thoughts of the volunteer — none of which  had been previously discussed. The recorded message was  mixed with what appeared to be white noise or static, so when  played back it became undecipherable. Since there were no  more volunteers in the U.S. group, the Russians volunteered to  go upstairs and let the Americans choose a mental patient for a  demonstration. The Americans declined the offer.  \"The Russians told Morris of a demonstration in which a',\n",

The staff sent an acoustic psycho-correction message  via their machine to the workers telling them to put down their  tools, knock on the door of the hospital and ask if there was  anything else they could do.

       " 'Unlike lie detectors, this machine can determine when the  truth is spoken, according to Morris.   \"Being an infrasound, very low frequency-type transmission,  the acoustic psycho-correction message is transmitted via bone  conduction.

In 1961, biophysicist Allen Frey, working for the  Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), announced that human  beings are capable of hearing microwave broadcasts, in the case  of his experiments, what he described as buzzing or knocking  sounds. Frey suggested \"stimulating the nervous system without  the damage caused by electrodes.\" [13]   In 1973, Dr. Joseph C.Sharp, at Walter Reed Hospital, while  in a soundproof room heard spoken words broadcast by \"pulsed',\n",

Seeds, Power and Mischief It is easy to see that control of seeds translates effectively to power—power over the farmer, power over what we eat, power over how much is available to eat, and power over what our food will cost. Even Jim Hightower, former Secretary of Agriculture for the State of Texas and usually a liberal who loves Big Government interference in almost every aspect of our lives, is taken aback by the potential mischief of the Terminator Gene. On the internet recently, Hightower complained about the U.S. Department of Agriculture “playing kissy-face with the giants of agribusiness',\n",
       " ' which keep finding new ways to mess with Mother Nature for their own fun and profit.” 13 “In their latest scheme,” writes Hightower, “government scientists and corporate profiteers have teamed up to mess up one of nature’s basics: seeds.” Hightower brands the new hybrids “barren seeds” and goes on to observe that, “Ever since there has been agriculture, farmers have saved their seeds from this year’s crop to replant next years... So along come the geniuses at USDA, using our tax dollars to develop a seed that will not germinate when replanted... Who would want such non-germinating',\n",

The seed corporations, of course, since it means every farmer in the world would have to come to them and buy new seeds.” 14 Hightower asks the pertinent question, why is a government agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, involved in this  \\x0cscenario? And he uncovers the revealing, if troubling, answer: “The world’s farmers and the genetic diversity of our food supply are in danger of being terminated. So why did USDA pursue it? The goal, according to an agency spokesman is ‘to increase the value of proprietary seeds owned by U.S. seed',\n",

Please examine below some of what Dr. Liebmann proposes in his shocking The Wall Street Journal article and come to',\n",
       " ' your own conclusions: The time has come for the eating public to face a stark reality: The consumption of food, if allowed to grow at the present rate, will bankrupt our great nation. Production of food has risen from 10% to more than 30% of the gross domestic product since 1945. The Congressional Budget Office projects that by the year 2010, Americans will spend more money and time on eating than on working, vacationing, and being sick combined. To counter this threat, a junior U.S. Senator (whose name has been withheld upon request) has begun to draft legislation',\n",
       " ' designed to fundamentally reform the way Americans consume food. The proposal, preliminarily dubbed “Managed Foodcare,” promotes the cost efficient consumption of food by regulating access to stores and restaurants. A brief outline will illustrate how the reforms benefit the average eater. Each year, during the last week of December, consumers have the choice of signing up at their preferred grocery store or restaurant for the year to come. These two main retail markets for the distribution of food are referred to as Primary Food Providers... Consumers will be obliged to',\n",
       " ' buy all their food at the chosen store and eat at the restaurant they elected. There will be a designated copayment, and together with their employer, they will also pay a monthly premium to a Food Management Organization (FMO). FMOs, whose formation will be encouraged under the legislation, are privately owned corporations. They control the production and manage the distribution of food based on a highly variable Cost Efficiency Quotient, whose numerical value is directly proportional to the value at which the FMOs’ stocks are traded on the open market. FMOs contract with',\n",

Basically, stores and restaurants will receive a fixed annual amount of money from their FMO for each enrolled customer,  \\x0cregardless of how much or little he consumes during the year. If the enrollee spends more than his allotment, it will be the provider’s loss; if less, it will be the provider’s gain. FMOs will maintain personal customer records listing all purchases, creating an “Individual Consumption Profile” (ICP) for each member. The ICP is subject to periodic review',\n",

Ultimately, Managed Foodcare will accelerate the accumulation of capital in the hands of those who know best how to promote a healthier and leaner America. 10',\n",

In terms of agriculture and food production, the restructuring of society will result in collective farms, defined in Webster’s dictionary as: “A farm, especially in a Communist country, formed from many small holdings collected into a single unit for joint operation under governmental supervision.” History provides many poignant examples of famine resulting from forced collectivization.

In the 1930s, President Roosevelt appointed as head of the Department of Agriculture Henry Wallace. Wallace, an avowed, dyed-in-the-wool Socialist, was, like his boss, FDR, a high-ranking initiate of the Masonic Lodge.

In 1934, a revealing article was published by a',\n",

Privately owned land will be controlled “to whatever extent is found necessary for maintaining continuous productivity,” he said.

That hope has not been realized,” said Tugwell.',\n",
       " ' Tugwell said present acreage reductions plans were only an emergency stop gap. “What is done is merely to keep a part of each field of each farm out of use,” he said. “It seems to me obvious that this cannot be a characteristic feature of a permanent policy.” As an alternative, Tugwell advocated controlling the total volume of farm products by limiting the area available for production, the government acquiring and devoting to other uses all land in excess of that needed for production. He envisioned “a commercial agriculture made up of the most efficient farmers operating the best of our lands.”',\n",
       " ' “Contrary to the desired trend, two million persons have returned to farms during the depression,” he said. “We already had too many farmers,“ Tugwell said. “We could probably raise all the farm products we need with half our present farmers, or twelve and one-half percent of our total working population.” “Private control has failed to use wisely its control of the land,” he concluded. “We are preparing a land program not merely for the benefit of those who held title to it but for the greater welfare of all the citizens of the country.” 13',\n",

This law would have assigned a quota to how many potatoes each farmer could grow and market.

Further, any farmer who sold unstamped potatoes, or any housewife or individual who bought such unstamped potatoes, would be subject to a fine and jail sentence.',\n",

There will be “a single Community meals center,” or cafeteria, where all families will eat in common. The Community will have just one church because everyone will have one faith—the New Age World Religion. The same building used for the church will be used to house the courts and the police. 13',\n",

However, God will give us the strength we need, at the exact time we need it, to stand.  \\x0cWith faith, we can foresee the future. This is a dynamic way to prepare. We should always include in our prayers a plea to the Lord to help us to know in advance what is in store for our lives. God often gives His children a picture of what is to occur.',\n",

We read in Proverbs 22:3: “A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.” It is true that God does not promise the Christian that he or she will not experience tribulation and sorrow.

(John 14:1-3)  Physical Preparation While the nourishment of the spiritual person is paramount and takes precedence, there is absolutely nothing wrong with making physical preparations for hard times. Again, the accounts of great Old Testament examples like Noah and Joseph come to mind. Noah believed and had faith in God, and he proved it by physical action—the building of an ark and the collection of',\n",

And when God gave advance word of the approaching famine, Joseph prepared by storing up food in the Pharaoh’s storehouses. He proved in action that he believed God’s advance warnings. Now, you and I have the opportunity to prove with our action that we believe the advance warning God is giving us. I suggest you pray and ask God exactly what He would have you to do to prepare—then, DO IT!',\n",

       " ' Ten Steps for Physical Preparation  1. Get Out of Financial Debt. Yes, I know this is easier said than done. With mortgages, credit cards, and all the other debt the average consumer is saddled with, many just cannot see their way to getting rid of debt. Nevertheless, I recommend you mount a superhuman effort, praying to the Father for the strength and means to escape the debt cycle. The Holy Bible, in its great wisdom, reminds us: “The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.” ( Proverbs',\n",
       " ' 22:7) 2. Store Up Food. A number of ministries and companies now offer dry food systems at an excellent value. For example, my own ministry offers dehydrated food in sealed cans and packages that is truly delicious and has a durable shelf life of several years. Then again, there are dry and canned foods available at your local supermarket that you can acquire and store away. With computers and modern inventory systems, the average supermarket operates on the accounting principle, “just in time.” This means that barely enough supplies of food are stocked, and the grocery store orders replacements just',\n",
       " ' in time to meet continuing demand. But when an emergency comes and trucks don’t deliver, that means big trouble for  \\x0ccustomers who do not have in their food pantries a sufficient reserve. I really believe it essential for a family to have a minimum of 60 to 90 days food on hand at all times. A family garden is also a wonderful idea, and canning your own food for later use can provide superb benefits. Remember, also, that Christians and patriots will be denied food and essentials during hard times once the universal “mark of the beast” system is inplemented. Anyone who takes the mark in order to',\n",
       " ' obtain food will be damned forever. So take heed and prepare. 3. Store Up Water. If you have your own water well, fantastic! Of course, if your well needs power, and the power company is out of business permanently or temporarily, you’re out of business. In that case, you should consider acquiring a generator that operates on diesel, gasoline, or other fuel. A standby generator is a wonderful thing to have around if the electric power for your home goes out, too. If you have no water well, then begin filling up clean and sterilized containers',\n",
       " ' with water. Distilled water is best, but tap water is OK, too. Use a teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide or a half-teaspoon of bleach per gallon to keep the water pure and free of bacteria. 4. Store Up Essentials. When the crunch comes, make sure you have essentials—batteries, fuel oil, candles, paper towels or cloths, tools, wrapping tape, soap, basic medicines and prescription medicines, first aid supplies, etc. How often do we hear of a hurricane heading for a coastal city in Florida, Texas, or North Carolina and grocery and hardware store shelves',\n",

If you need a tooth filled or pulled—do it now. When hard times come, a dentist may not be available—or his office won’t have the electric power for him to operate his high tech drills and instruments, etc. Likewise, if you’ve been putting off that minor operation to remove that ingrown toenail, do it as soon as possible. That goes for any minor—or major—surgical procedure. It goes without saying that in preparation for',\n",

We should eat right. Sugars, sweets and starches—well, you and I know they’re not good for us. In fact, they’re deadly. And alcohol—I think it’s only useful to pickle things, don’t you? 6.

Living in the country is going to be best, especially to avoid riots and plundering by mobs, expected to occur in cities and adjoining suburbs. But not everyone has the financial ability or the opportunity to live in the country. As a minimum, ask yourself how you will protect yourself and your lived ones in time of trouble.

But, the person who would be rich brings upon himself misery and trouble. Remember, the Apostle Paul said he was content no matter what his circumstances. Even in prison, he was satisfied, for the Lord was with him. Are the super-rich who reject the Lord and who persecute God’s people “prosperous?” Maybe, by the world’s standards.',\n",
